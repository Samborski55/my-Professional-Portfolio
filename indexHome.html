            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. I am Cody Samborski, I am trained as a career firefighter, and a full-stack web developer. I am located out of Minneapolis, MN and I am seeking remote employment in the development community.</p>
            <p>I am currently employed as a career firefighter, for the City of Minneapolis. This is an extremly competitive career in which I had to compete with six-thousand other individuals for seventy-five firefighter positions in my hiring process. This career allows for a very liberal schedule that allows me to persue multiple dreams. From my tenure here alone, I have gained nine years experience in a high stress and fast paced environments. I am often required to work in situations that are demanding, unfamiliar, and require me to think on my feet. As a firefighter I have developed the skills to stay current with education in my chosen industries, to train on my off time, and give 100% effort in everything I persue. These life skills, along with my liberal work schedule, and my completetion of full stack web development training, have prepared me to successfully launch a career in the programming space.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I have unknowingly prepared myself for a career in development. I have developed traits such as self-sufficience, self-motivation, strong logic, and the ability to learn efficently. These traits have helped temendously in acquiring skills throughout my time enrolled in the Southern Methodist University Coding Bootcamp. With detailed knowlege in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am excited to launch my career and do my part in writing outstanding code, that will help better our world.</p>
